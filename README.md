# Chat App Project

Created using JavaScript, React Router and Firebase.

An online messaging application.
* Users can sign up for a new account. A valid email and password must be provided.
* Users must login to view and send chat messages.
* Firebase is used to create and authenticate user accounts, and save chat messages.
* Protected routes are used so the application cannot be accessed unless logged in to an authenticated user account. Trying to go to the chat room URL without an account sends you back to the login page.
